### Hello!

My name is Zgell! I'm a hobbyist programmer and computer engineering student who works on all sorts of projects. My main programming languages are:
- Python
- MATLAB
- C++
- HTML/CSS
- VHDL

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some small-scale projects while I'm in school
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about VHDL and what I can do with it
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something interesting
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing at the moment
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my ENCMP 100 contest submission if you're interested
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Zgell#0436 on Discord.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been programming since I was 10 years old!
